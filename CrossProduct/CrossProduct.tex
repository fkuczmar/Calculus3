\section{Rotating About an Axis}

Imagine rotating three-dimensional space about an axis, as if space were a block of ice with its points fixed in position relative to one another. How can we determine the velocity velocity of a point in the frozen block at some instant in time?

You may have seen a version of this problem in two-dimensions.

\begin{question}   \label{Qdfg4bk:Cross}
Which of the following is a reasonable approximation of the rate at which point $P$ rotates about the origin in the animation below?
\begin{multipleChoice}  
\choice{$2\pi$ rad/sec}
\choice{$\pi/2$ rad/sec}  
\choice[correct]{$3$ rad/sec} 
\choice{$0.5$ rad/sec} 
\choice{$12$ rad/sec}
\end{multipleChoice}  
\end{question}


(b) Using the rate of rotation from part (a), compute the speed of $P$ as it moves around the circle of radius $20$ meters. Explain your reasoning.

(c) What is the speed $v$ (in meters/sec) of a point rotating about the center of a circle of radius $r$ meters at the constant rate of $\omega$ rad/sec.

Suppose instead we wanted to find the velocity of the point $P$ in the animation above. Velocity is a vector; it is the rate at which the position of an object changes with respect to time. The (instanteous) velocity vector points in the direction of motion and is  tangent to the path. The magnitude of the vector gives the speed of the motion. While the speed of point $P$ in the above animation is constant, its velocity is not. That's because $P$ does not move in a fixed direction.

\begin{question}   \label{Q3456457l:Cross}
(d) Activate the velocity folder in the above animation. Then use the rotation rate from part (a) to find the velocity of $P$ as it passes the point $Q$ with coordinates $(12,16)$.
\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{Qdstjigvgf:Cross}
(a) Drag $Q$ and describe how the direction and magnitude of the vector ${\bf w}\times {\overrightarrow{QP}}$ change as you move $Q$ from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$ along the line.

(b) Use vector algebra to justify your assertion.  {\it Hint:}
