\begin{question}  \label{Q:943r34r34}
A regulation limits the maximum dimension (length, width, or height) of a box taken onto a city bus to be at most $3.5$ feet. Can you find a way to carry a six-foot long fishing pole onto a bus? Explain.
\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Q:9df33334}
Find an equation of the sphere centered at the point $(3,-2,4)$ that passes through the point $(1,1,-3)$. Explain the \emph{logic} behind the equation.
\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{Q44435313}
Describe and sketch each of the following sets of points.

(a) $\{ (x,y) \, | \, y=x^2 \}$

(b) $\{ (x,y,z) \, | \, y=x^2 \}$
\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Qpo8873032}
Let ${\cal L}_1$ be the line through the point $(0,0,1)$ parallel to the $y$-axis. Let ${\cal L}_2$ be the line through the point $(0,0,-1)$ parallel to the $x$-axis.

(a) Try to visualize or sketch the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ equidistant from ${\cal L}_1$ and ${\cal L_2}$.

(b) Find an equation of the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ equidistant from ${\cal L}_1$ and ${\cal L_2}$. Explain your logic.

\begin{hint}
Start by finding an expression for the distance between the point with coordinates $(x,y,z)$ and the line ${\cal L}_1$.
\end{hint}

(c) Enter  your equation in the worksheet below. Do the points on the surface look like they satisfy the condition? Explain.
