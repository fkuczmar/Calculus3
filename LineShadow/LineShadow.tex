\begin{question} \label{Qfer8344dfdf3}

With a distant light source in the direction of the vector ${\bf w}$, a thin rod casts a shadow on the three coordinate planes as shown below. The rod runs between the points $A$ in the $xz$-plane and $B$ in the $yz$-plane.

Try working in general, but if need be work with the specific points $A$ and $B$ and vector ${\bf w}$ above.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Express the positions (relative to the origin) of the points where the shadow intersects the coordinate axes in terms of the vectors $\overrightarrow{OA}$, $\overrightarrow{OB}$, and ${\bf w}$. Here $O$ is the origin.

\item Now suppose a beetle crawls along the rod with constant velocity ${\bf v}$. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Watch the animation above and describe how the velocity of the beetle's shadow changes as the shadow moves from one coordinate plane to another.

\item Express the velocitiy of the shadow in each of the coordinate planes in terms of the vectors ${\bf v}$ and ${\bf w}$. 

\item Express the speed of the shadow in each of the three coordinate planes in terms of the vectors ${\bf v}$ and ${\bf w}$.

\end{enumerate}
