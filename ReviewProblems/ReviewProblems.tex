\maketitle

Here are some sample finals. They are \emph{not} necessarily indicative of the exact types of problems you will see on the final, nor are they meant to be an exhaustive list of all the types of problems. But they should give you some general idea of what to expect.

Neither calculators or notes will be permitted.
