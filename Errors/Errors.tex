\begin{question} \label{PDLf3909bv}

This question is about the series
\[
    \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{1+k^2} .
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine if the series converges or diverges by comparing it with the appropriate improper integral. Explain your reasoning fully in complete sentences. Draw a picture to help with your exlanation.

\item Find an upper bound for the error in approximating the series with the sum of the first ten terms.

\item At least how many terms of the series would you need to sum to approximate the series with an error of at most $10^8$?

\end{enumerate}
