\section{Left or Right}

\begin{question} \label{Wmfdmr3r0b}
Suppose the motion ${\bf p}(t)$ of Question 1 lies in the $xy$-plane of three-dimensional space. Write an inequality that describes when the beetle is turning left from the perspective of an observor looking down on the plane from the positive $z$-axis.

\section{The Principal Normal Vector}

Let ${\bf p}(t)$ be a beetle's position function and let ${\bf v}(t)$ and ${\bf a}(t)$ be its velocity and acceleration functions.

The unit tangent 
\[
   {\bf T}(t)  =\frac{{\bf v}(t)}{|{\bf v}(t)|}
\]
of the motion is easy to understand. It's just the unit vector in the direction of motion.

The \emph{principal normal} ${\bf N}(t)$ is a vector normal to ${\bf T}(t)$. For a motion in two-dimensions there are two directions normal to ${\bf T}(t)$. The vector ${\bf N}(t)$ points in the direction in which the beetle is turning. So if the beetle is making a left turn, the principal normal is normal to the curve and points to the beetle's left. For a right turn, ${\bf N}(t)$ points to the beetle's left.

But in three dimensions, there is an entire circle of directions normal to the unit tangent. How is it possible to pick out one of these as being the unit normal?
