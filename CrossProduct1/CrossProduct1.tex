\begin{question}  \label{Q34325rhgt}
(a) How many vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are orthogonal to both ${\bf a}= \langle 1, 3,2 \rangle$ and ${\bf b}=\langle -4,3,-1 \rangle$?
 \begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{none}
\choice{one}
\choice{two}
\choice[correct]{infinitely many} 
\end{multipleChoice}

(b) How many directions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are orthogonal to both ${\bf a}= \langle 1, 3,2 \rangle$ and ${\bf b}=\langle -4,3,-1 \rangle$?
 \begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{none}
\choice{one}
\choice[correct]{two}
\choice{infinitely many} 
\end{multipleChoice}


Suppose we wish to find the components of a vector ${\bf v}=\langle x, y , z \rangle \in \mathbb{R}^3$ perpendicular to the vectors ${\bf a}=\langle a_1, a_2, a_3 \rangle, {\bf b}=\langle b_1, b_2, b_3 \rangle \in \mathbb{R}^3$.  Necessary and sufficient conditions are that
\[
 \begin{cases}
 {\bf v}\cdot {\bf a} = a_1 x + a_2 y +a_3 z  = \answer{0}  \\
 {\bf v}\cdot {\bf b} = b_1 x + b_2 y +b_3 z  = \answer{0} .
\end{cases}
\]

Eliminating $x$ from this system of equations leads to
\[
    (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1)y + (\answer{a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1})z = \answer{0}  .
\]
And one simple solution to this last equation is
\[
     y = a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1  \text{ and } z = \answer{a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2} 
\]
and therefore 
\[
       (x, y, z) = (   \answer{a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}     ,    \answer{ a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1}        ,    \answer{a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2}    )
\]
is a solution to the system.

Another equally simple solution is
\[ 
         (x, y, z) = (   a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1     ,     a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3        ,   a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1    ) .
\]

It's a minor miracle that of the infinitely many solutions to our original system, it's the two simplest ones above that are the most useful. By convention, the latter
\[ 
         (x, y, z) = (   a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1     ,     a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3        ,   a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1    ) = {\bf a}\times {\bf b}
\]
is the cross-product ${\bf a}\times {\bf b}$.

To better understand this, suppose ${\bf a}$ and ${\bf b}$ are parallel to the $xy$-plane. Then the $\answer{z}$-
