\section{Position Vectors}

Position is relative. You describe where something is not in absolute terms but only in relation to something else.

We might say, for example, that Bellevue is 4 miles east and 3 miles north of Akron. Then in a rectangular coordinate system with the $x$-axis pointing due east, the $y$-axis pointing due north, and the coordinates measured in miles, we can represent the position of Bellevue (at point $B$) relative to Akron (at point $A$) by the vector
\[
   \overrightarrow{AB} = \langle 4, 3 \rangle .
\]
This vector tells how to get from Akron to Bellevue. 


Suppose that in our rectangular coordinate sytstem Charleston (point $C$) has coordinates $(-5,-2)$ and Dayton (point $D$) has coordinates $(-1,1)$. Then to get from Charleston to Dayton we would travel east
\[
     ( -1 - (-5) ) \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}
\]
and north
\[
     ( 1 - (-2)) \text{ miles} = 3\text{ miles} .
\]
So we can represent the position of Dayton relative to Charleston by the vector
\[
  \overrightarrow{CD} =       \langle -1 - (-5) , 1- (-2)  \rangle   =  \langle 4, 3 \rangle .
\] 

So the directions that tell us how to get from Akron to Bellevue also tell us how to get from Charleston to Dayton. The
vectors $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{CD}$ are equal and we write 
\[
      \overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{CD} .
\]

To go the other way and get from Bellevue to Akron or from Dayton to Charleston, we would go 4 miles west and 3 miles south. So the  position of Akron relative to Bellevue, or of Charleston relative to Dayton, is given by the vector
\[ 
   \overrightarrow{BA} = - \overrightarrow{AB} = - \langle 4,3 \rangle =  \langle -4,-3 \rangle.
\]

The distance between Akron and Bellvue is just the length of the vector $\overrightarrow{AB}$, written as
\[
    | \overrightarrow{AB}  | =  | \langle 3, 4 \rangle  | \text{ miles} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} \text{miles} = 5 \text{ miles} .
\] 


\section{Adding and Subtracting Vectors}

\begin{question}    \label{Q234234:Vectors}
Continuing with our example above, suppose that Frankfort (point $F$) is $2$ miles east and $5$ miles south of Bellevue. Then the vector
\[
    \overrightarrow{BF}  = \langle \answer{2}, \answer{-5}\rangle
\]
gives the position of Frankfort relative to Bellvue. 
\end{question}

\begin{question} \label{Q233:Vectors}

\]

(c) Which of the following are correct? Choose all that apply.

\section{Writing Equations with Vectors}

\begin{question}  \label{Eq:32404:Vectors}
In the following questions, we use capital letters like $A$ to denote points and the corresponding boldfaced lower case letter, like ${\bf a}$, to denote the vector from the origin to the point. Also, we use the vector ${\bf r}$ to denote a vector from the origin to the point with coordinates $(x,y)$ in two-dimensions or to the point $(x,y,z)$ in three dimensions.
