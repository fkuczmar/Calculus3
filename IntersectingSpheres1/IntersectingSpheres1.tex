\begin{question}   \label{ExsSpheres}
This problem is about two intersecting spheres and their circle of intersection.

We'll let 
\[
    {\bf p} = \langle x, y ,z \rangle
\]
be the position of the point $P$ with coordinates $(x,y,z)$ relative to the origin $O$.

Now suppose the two spheres have equations
\[
      |{\bf p} - {\bf a}_1| = r_1
\]
 and
\[
     |{\bf p} - {\bf a}_2| = r_2,
\]
where the vectors 
\[
   {\bf a}_i = \overrightarrow{OA_i} \, , \, i=1,2,
\]
are the positions of the sphere's centers relative to the origin.

Assuming the spheres intersect (in a circle), our goal is to express the position vector
\[
      {\bf c} = \overrightarrow{OC}
\]
of the circle's center (relative to $O$) in terms of the vectors ${\bf a}_i$ and the radii $r_i$ of the spheres.

The idea is to imagine a point $Q$ (orangle above) on the circle of intersection and consider $\Delta A_1QA_2$. To see this triangle turn off the folder \emph{Spheres} in Line 6 above.

\begin{enumerate}

\item First use the law of cosines in $\Delta A_1QA_2$ to express $\cos (\angle QA_1A_2)$ in terms of the vectors ${\bf a}_i$ and the radii $r_i$.

\item Then find an expression for the vector $\overrightarrow{A_1C}$.

\item Finally, find an expression for the vector $\overrightarrow{OC}$.
\end{enumerate}
