\section{The Velocity Vector}

\begin{exploration}
Suppose  you're driving your car along a winding road. The instantaneous velocity of your car at some moment is the rate of change in its position with repsect to time. Since position is a vector, so is velocity. It has a direction and magnitude. The direction points in the direction you are moving  and the magnitude gives your speed.

But just like all other rates of change, we can speak about average velocity. And we really should speak about this first. Your average velocity over a time interval is the change in your position divided by the length of the interval. This is also a vector.

The geogebra worksheet below suggest a projectile motion in a uniform graviational field. The position of the projectile is plotted at equally-spaced time intervals along its trajectory. The time $u$ is measured in seconds and the position vectors are measured in meters.

The vector ${\bf v}_{avg}$ represents the average velocity between times $u=-1.4$ and $u=-1.4+\Delta t = 1.6$. 

\begin{question}  \label{Qfdhgyuj:Motion}
(a) Which vector gives the change in position going forward in time from time $u=-1.4$ to time $u=1.6$ seconds. 
\begin{multipleChoice}  
\choice[correct]{${\bf r}_Q - {\bf r}_P$}  
\choice{${\bf r}_P - {\bf r}_Q$}  
\choice{$0.5({\bf r}_P + {\bf r}_Q)$}  
\end{multipleChoice}  


(b) (a) Which vector gives the average velocity ${\bf v}_{avg}$ between times $u=-1.4$ to time $u=1.6$ seconds. 
\begin{multipleChoice}  
\choice[correct]{$\frac{1}{3}\left({\bf r}_Q - {\bf r}_P\right)$}  
\choice{$\frac{1}{3}\left({\bf r}_P - {\bf r}_Q\right)$}  
\choice{$0.5({\bf r}_P + {\bf r}_Q)$}  
\end{multipleChoice}  


(c) True or False? 
The magnitude $| {\bf v}_{avg} |$ of the average velocity vector measures the average speed of the projectile between times $u=-1.4$ to time $u=1.6$ seconds.
\begin{multipleChoice}  
\choice[correct]{False}  
\choice{True}  
\end{multipleChoice}  




(d) Slide $\Delta t$ toward zero and watch how the average velocity vector changes. What can you say about the direction of this vector as $\Delta t \to 0$? What does this tell you about the direction of the instanstaneous velocity vector? 

(e) In light of part (c), is it true that the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity vector equals the speed of the motion? Explain your reasoning.

(f) Move point $P$ with the slider $u$ and repeat part (c). How do the speeds of the motion compare at times $u=-1.4$ and your other time?

\section{Graphing the Velocity Function}
One way to graph the velocity function, or the average velocity function computed over some constant time interval, is to pin the velocity vectors with their tails at a common point. The tips of these clustered velocity vectors (instantaneous or average) trace out a curve. The next two demonstrations show examples, the first for projectile motion in a uniform gravitational field, the second for motion along cycloids.

\section{From Velocity to Position}


\begin{question}  \label{Qdst65nvcy}
Given the velocity function ${\bf v}(t)$ of a motion, which of the following are also necessray to determine the position function? Choose all that apply.
\begin{selectAll}  
    \choice{The acceleration function}  
    \choice{The velocity at a particular time}  
    \choice[correct]{The position at a particular time}  
    \choice{The velocity function is sufficient. Nothing else is needed.}  
  \end{selectAll}
\end{question}


Backing up for a moment, let's review a key idea from Integral Calculus.
\begin{question}  \label{Qddggt5t6vcy}
Suppose the continuous function 
\[
    r=g(t) , 0\leq t \leq 6 ,
\]
expresses the rate (in gallons/min) at which water flows into a tank in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Suppose also that the tank holds $20$ gallons at time $t=t_0$ minutes past noon. Which of the following functions gives the volume of water (in gallons) in the tank at time $t$ minutes past noon? Choose all that apply. Explain your reasoning.
\begin{selectAll}  
    \choice{$f(t) = 20 + r(t)$}  
    \choice{$f(t) = \int r(t)\, dt + C$}  
    \choice{$f(t) =\int r(t)\, dt + C$}
    \choice{$f(t) =\int_{t_0}^t r(u)\, du$}  
    \choice[correct]{$f(t) =20 + \int_{t_0}^t r(u)\, du$}  
  \end{selectAll}
\end{question}

One way to approximte the volume function is to use a step function to approximate the rate function. That is, we partition the interval $t\in [0,6]$ into subintervals, usually of equal lengths, and assume that the rate of flow is constant over each interval. The resulting volume function is then piecewise linear. 

Experiment with the Desmos demonstration below to see this.

\begin{question}    \label{Qedtrg78}
We can apply these same ideas to find the position function of a motion given its (continuous) velocity function ${\bf v}(t)$ (as a function of the number of seconds past noon and measured in say meters/sec) and the position ${\bf p}_0$ (in meters) at time $t=t_0$ seconds past noon.  

Which of the following functions gives the position (in meters) at time $t$ seconds past noon? Choose all that apply.
\begin{selectAll}  
      \choice{${\bf p}(t) = \int {\bf v}(t)\, dt + C$}  
       \choice{${\bf p}(t) = \int_{t_0}^t r(u)\, du$} 
    \choice{${\bf p}(t) = {\bf p}_0 + \int_{t_0}^u {\bf v}(t)\, dt$}  
    \choice[correct]{${\bf p}(t) = {\bf p}_0 + \int_{t_0}^t {\bf v}(u)\, du$}  
  \end{selectAll}
\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Qdeggbfr4}
Suppose now that 
\[
    {\bf v}(t) = \langle \cos\left( \frac{t^2}{2\pi} \right) , \sin\left( \frac{t^2}{2\pi} \right) \rangle , t\geq 0 ,
\]
and that 
\[
{\bf p}(0) = \langle 3, -5 \rangle .
\]

(a) Find an expression for the position function.

(b) Change the first slider to $n=4$ in the demonstration below. Then drag slider $u$ to see the velocity hodograph. Use the four vectors in the hodograph to sketch a piece-wise linear approximation to the trajectory of the motion. Explain your reasoning.

(c) Drag slider $u$ back to $u=0$. Then click the ``segments'' box in the upper left. Then drag the slider $u$. Explain what you see. How does the path compare with your approximation in part (b)?

(d) Drag slider $u$ back to $u=0$. Increase the value of $n$ and drag slider $u$. Explain what you see. What happens as you increase $n$?

\section{Ball on an Inclined Plane}

\begin{question}  \label{Qefd46365}
A small mass slides on an inclined plane without friction in a uniform graviational field with gravitational acceleration $g \;  m/sec^2$. The mass passes the point $P_0$ with coordinates $(p_1, p_2, p_3 )$ in the plane at time $t=t_0$ seconds with velocity ${\bf v}_0 = \langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \rangle$m/sec.  The vector ${\bf n} =\langle n_1, n_2, n_3\rangle$ is normal to the plane.

Find a function ${\bf p}(t)$ that expresses the position of the mass relative to the origin in terms of time, measured in seconds. Work with the vectors ${\bf p}_0$ from the origin to $P_0$, ${\bf g} = \langle 0, 0, -g \rangle$, ${\bf v}_0$, and ${\bf n}$. Avoid working with their components.

{\it Hint:}  The mass slides with constant acceleration equal to the vector component of ${\bf g}$ parallel to the plane.

Between times $t=2$ and $t=5$ seconds past noon, the gnat flies with a constant velocity. Find a multi-part function that gives the gnat's position (in meters) relative to the origin between times $t=0$ and $t=5$. 

\end{question}


\begin{question} \label{Qcbh65y6:Motion}
At a certain instant, a gnat has position
\[
   {\bf r}_0 = \langle -2, 5, 4\rangle \text{ meters}
\]
relative to the origin and is moving with velocity
\[
  {\bf v}_0 = \langle  2, 1,-1  \rangle \text{ m/sec} .
\]

(a) Is the distance between the gnat and the origin increasing or decreasing at this instant? At what rate? Justify your answer.

(b) Is the distance between the gnat and the point $(1,2,1)$ increasing or decreasing at this instant? At what rate? 

(c) At this same instant, the distance from the gnat to a point $P$ is neither increasing or decreasing. Find possible coordinates of $P$.

\begin{exploration}

The animation below shows the motion
\[
   {\bf p}_b(t) = \langle a\cos (\omega t), b \sin (\omega t)  \rangle \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2\pi 
\]
of the rear wheel of a bicycle around an ellipse, where the components are measured in meters and time $t$ in seconds.
Here $a$, $b$, and $\omega$ are positive constants.
