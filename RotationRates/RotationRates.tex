\section{Introduction}

Here's the question for this chapter.

Suppose at a certain instant, you are $20$ miles from home and driving at a speed of $50$ miles/hour. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item What can you say, if anything, about the rate (with respect to time) at which you are rotating about your home at this instant? Can you find lower and upper bounds for this rate?

\item What additional information would you need to determine this rate? 
\end{enumerate}


\begin{question} \label{QRAZxdr3r3}

The function
\[
 {\bf p}(t) = \langle  3+5\cos t,4+2\ \sin t \rangle \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2\pi ,
\]
expresses the position (in meters) of a beetle relative to the origin in terms of the number of minutes past noon.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Play the slider $u$ in Line 2. Then sketch a graph of the function
\[
       \theta = f(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2\pi ,
\] 
that expresses the marked angle $\theta$ (measured in radians) as a function of the number of minutes past noon.

\item Use your graph in part (a) to sketch a graph of the function 
\[
  r = \frac{d\theta}{dt} = f^\prime(t) \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2\pi .
\]

\item Explain the meaning of the function $r=f^\prime(t)$ in this context. Include units in your explanation.

\item Activate the folder \emph{Graphs} in Line 8 to see how you did.

\end{enumerate}
\end{question}



\begin{question}  \label{Q8fre3rr}
This is a continuation of the first problem, but instead of working with the specific position function there, we'll make things easier and work in general.

So we'll suppose the position function (relative to the origin, measured in meters) is
\[
      {\bf p}(t) = \langle f(t), g(t) \rangle ,
\]
with input $t$ measured in the number of seconds past noon.

Our goal is to find an expression for the function $r = h(t)$ that gives the beetle's rotation rate (in rad/sec) about the origin at time $t$ seconds past noon. This is really a related-rates problem and we'll use ideas from differential calculus to solve it.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write an equation that relates the component functions $f(t)$, $g(t$) of the position vector and the signed angle $\theta$ from the positive $x$-axis to the position vector, measured counterclockwise.

\item Then differentiate both sides of your equation with respect to time to find an expression for the rotation rate function $r=\omega(t)$.

\item Check that your function is dimensionally correct.

\item Use your function and the position function from Question 1 to determine these rates of rotation at times $t=0$ and $t=3\pi/2$ minutes past noon.
\end{enumerate}

\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{QLDferfMAZ}
This question relates the ideas in the previous question to vectors.

The goal here is to relate the signed rotation rate about the origin to the vector product 
\[
 {\bf L}(t) = {\bf p}(t) \times {\bf v}(t)
\]
of the position and velocity vectors of the motion.

\begin{enumerate}

\item What are the units of the vector ${\bf L}(t)$ when the position vector is measured in meters and time in seconds?

\item Watch the motion above (the orange vector is ${\bf L}(t)$). Sometimes ${\bf L}(t)$ points upward, sometimes downward. Why?

\item Let ${\bf k} = \langle 0,0,1\rangle$. What is the relationship between the position and velocity vectors ${\bf p}(t)$, ${\bf v}(t)$ when

\begin{enumerate}
\item ${\bf L}(t)\cdot {\bf k}>0$.

\item ${\bf L}(t)\cdot {\bf k}<0$.
\[
  {\bf L}(t) = \langle 0,0,0 \rangle.
\] 
\end{enumerate}

\item Make a guess and express the signed rotation rate of the motion about the origin in terms of the vectors ${\bf L}(t)$ and ${\bf p}(t)$. Make sure your expression has the correct units.

\item Use the result of Question 1 to prove your conjecture. Start by finding an expression for the vector ${\bf L}(t)$ for the general motion
\[
  {\bf p}(t) = \langle f(t), g(t) \rangle .
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


The takeaway is this:

The signed rotation rate about the origin for a motion ${\bf p}(t)$ in the $xy$-plane is equal to %the scalar projection
\[
   \omega(t) =  \frac{ ( {\bf p}(t) \times {\bf v}(t) ) \cdot {\bf k}}{\left| {\bf p}(t) \right|^2} .
\]
This is the quotient of the scalar projection of the vector 
\[
    {\bf L}(t) = {\bf p}(t) \times {\bf p}^\prime(t)
\] 
in the direction ${\bf k} = \langle 0,0,1 \rangle$ of the positive $z$-axis and the square of the distance $|{\bf p}(t)|$ from the origin.

The rotation rate is positive when the motion rotates counterclockwise about the origin when viewed looking down on the $xy$-plane from the positive $z$-axis. It is negative for a clockwise rotation.

We can also write the \emph{absolute} rotation rate as
\[
   \left| \omega(t)  \right| = \frac{\left| {\bf v}(t)  \right| \sin\phi}{\left|  {\bf p}(t) \right|} ,
\]
where $\phi$ is the angle between the position and velocity vectors. This rate is never negative and does not capture the sense of rotation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check that this expression is dimensionally correct.

\item Use properties of the vector product to show this expression for $\omega(t)$ is equal to the one above.

\item This formula for the rotation rate is closely related to something your learned in trigonometry. What?

\item Explain intuitively why this expression gives the rotation rate.

\end{enumerate}
