\section{Introduction}

Here's the question for this chapter.

Suppose at a certain instant, you are $20$ miles from home and driving at a speed of $50$ miles/hour. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item What can you say, if anything, about the rate (with respect to time) at which you are rotating about your home at this instant? Can you find lower and upper bounds for this rate?

\item What additional information would you need to determine this rate? 
\end{enumerate}


\begin{question} \label{QRAZxdr3r3}

The function
\[
 {\bf p}(t) = \langle  3+5\cos t,4+2\ \sin t \rangle \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2\pi ,
\]
expresses the position (in meters) of a beetle relative to the origin in terms of the number of minutes past noon.
