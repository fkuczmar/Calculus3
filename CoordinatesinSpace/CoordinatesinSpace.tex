\section*{Introduction}
The first part of this chapter is about spheres. The following questions get at the key points and I'm asking them now to give you a chance to work through the these ideas on your own.


\begin{question}   \label{QLMn4947332}
\begin{freeResponse}
(a) Can a thin wooden dowel 15 inches long fit (without bending) in a shoe box with dimensions $4"\times 8"\times 12"$?

(b) What do we mean by a sphere of radius 5 feet centered at origin? Be precise.

(c) In trying to determine whether or not the point $P(4,3,-1)$ lies inside, on, or outside the sphere of part (b), a student reasons that because the three coordinates are each less than $5$ in absolute value, the point $P$ lies inside the sphere. Is that reasoning correct? Explain why or why not. If not, answer the question by giving a complete explanation that uses the ideas of parts (a) and (b). 

%(i) $(4,3,1)$

%(ii) $(4,2,-1)$

(d) The reasoning given in part (c) answers a different question about whether or not the point $P$ lies inside, on, or outside  some other surface. What surface? Explain.

(e) Find all possible values of $b$ that put the point with coordinates $(2,b,1)$ on the sphere of part (b).

(f) Complete the following sentence using everday English without using any mathematical notation or vocabulary:
\pskip

\emph{A point $P$ lies on the sphere of radius $5$ feet centered at the origin if and only if ...}

\pskip

(g)  Now suppose the point $P$ has coordinates $(x,y,z)$ and translate your condition from part (b) into an equation of the sphere.
 
(h) What do we mean by a sphere of radius 4 feet centered at the point $(3,2,1) feet$? Find an equation of such a sphere and explain how the equation encodes the meaning.

\end{freeResponse}

\end{question}


\section*{Computing Distances in Space}
We wish to compute the distance between the points $P_1$ and $P_2$ in space with respective coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$. The idea is to draw a box with its edges parallel to the coordinate axes and with the points $P_1$ and $P_2$ as opposite vertices. The 12 edges of this box come in three sets of four, the four in each set being parallel to one of the three coordinate axes. 

\begin{question} \label{Q324tgtgt}
What is the length of the four edges parallel to the $x$-axis? Choose all that apply. 
\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$x_2-x_1$}
\choice{$y_2-y_1$}
\choice{$z_2-z_1$}
\choice[correct]{$|x_2-x_1|$}
\choice{$|y_2-y_1|$}
\choice{$|z_2-z_1|$}
\choice[correct]{$\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2}$}
\end{selectAll}
\end{question}

\begin{question} \label{Q32sdfdsftgt}
What is the length of a diagonal in one of the two faces parallell to the $yz$-plane? Choose all that apply. 
\begin{selectAll}
\choice{$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 +(y_2-y_1)^2 }$}
\choice[correct]{$\sqrt{(y_2-y_1)^2 +(z_2-z_1)^2 }$}
\choice{$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 +(z_2-z_1)^2 }$}
\choice{$\sqrt{|x_2-x_1|^2 +|y_2-y_1|^2 }$}
\choice[correct]{$\sqrt{|y_2-y_1|^2 +|z_2-z_1|^2 }$}
\choice{$\sqrt{|x_2-x_1|^2 +|z_2-z_1|^2 }$}
\end{selectAll}
\end{question}

\begin{question} \label{Q32sdfdsftgt}
What is the length of the main diagonal $\overline{P_1P_2}$? Choose all that apply. 
\begin{selectAll}
\choice[correct]{$\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 +(y_2-y_1)^2  + (z_2-z_1)^2}$}
\choice[correct]{$\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 +(y_2-y_1)^2  + (z_1-z_2)^2}$}
\choice[correct]{$\sqrt{|x_2-x_1|^2 +|y_2-y_1|^2  + |z_2-z_1|^2}$}
\end{selectAll}
\end{question}

\begin{question}  \label{Q:Kmm3454433}
\begin{freeResponse}
Draw a picture of a box in a coordinate system to illustrate the above computations. Label the vertices $P_1$ and $P_2$,  three edges with their different lengths, and two diagonals with their different lengths. 
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}

\section*{Spheres}
A sphere is the set of all points in space that are a fixed distance from a given point. The equation of a sphere is a consequence of this definition and it is important to understand the logic behind this equation.

\begin{question}   \label{QDfsdgfte}
To find an equation of the sphere of radius $5$ centered at the point $A(3,1,-2)$, the key idea is this: a point $P$ lies on this sphere  if and only if the distance $\text{dist}(A,P)$ between $P$ and $A$ is equal to $5$. To translate this geometric condition into an algebraic description, let $P$ have coordinates $(x,y,z)$. Then $P$ lies on the sphere if and only if
\[
   \text{dist}(A,P) = 5 ,
\]
or if and only if 
\[
      \answer{\sqrt{(x-3)^2+ (y-1)^2 + (z+2)^2}} = 5   .
\]
And that's an equation of the sphere of radius $5$ centered at the point $(3,1,-2)$.
\end{question}





\section*{Tangent Spheres}
Two spheres are \emph{tangent} to each other if they intersect in exactly one point. They are said to be \emph{internally} tangent if one sphere lies inside the other and \emph{externally} tangent otherwise.

\begin{question}   \label{Q9sdf43gt4t44}
(a) How many spheres centered at the point $A(2,-3,6)$ are tangent to the sphere $x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = 9$?

(b) Find equations of the sphere(s) in part (a). Explain your reasoning. 

(c) Check your answer to part (b) by entering the equation(s) in the demonstration below.

\end{question}



\section*{Center Sets, Part 1}
\begin{question}   \label{Q5453466366}
\begin{freeResponse}
(a) Is the point $Q(2,3,-2)$ the center of a sphere through the points $A(1,-3,4)$ and $B(5,1,-6)$? Explain your reasoning.

(b) Complete the following sentence using everyday English.

\pskip

\emph{A point $P$ is the center of a sphere through the points $A(1,-3,4)$ and $B(5,1,-6)$ if and only if ...}

(c) Use part (b) to describe geometrically the set of points that are centers of spheres through the points $A$ and $B$.

(d) Now suppose $P$ has coordinates $(x,y,z)$ and translate your condition from part (c) into an equation of the set of points that are centers of spheres through the points $A(1,-3,4)$ and $B(5,1,-6)$.

(e) Find an equation of the smallest sphere through $A(1,-3,4)$ and $B(5,1,-6)$.

(f) Use part (d) to find an equation of another sphere through $A(1,-3,4)$ and $B(5,1,-6)$.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{question}



\section*{Spheres in a Corner}
\begin{question}  \label{Q3442g455t}
(a) How many spheres of radius $3$ are tangent to the planes $x=0$, $y=0$, and $z=0$?

(b) Find equations of two such spheres.

(c) Find an equation of the sphere of radius $a > 0$ in the first octant tangent to the three coordinate planes. Enter this equation in Line 2 of the worksheet below. Check that you are correct by dragging the slider $a$.

\begin{exploration}
\begin{onlineOnly}
    \begin{center}
\desmosThreeD{ljizsai4mu}{900}{600}
\end{center}
\end{onlineOnly}

(d) Drag the slider $a$ above to determine how many spheres tangent to the three coordinate planes pass through the point $(4,3,5)$. Then find equations of all these spheres.

(e) Do you think there are any points with strictly positive coordinates that do not lie on any sphere tangent to the coordinate planes? Explain. Then find the coordinates of one such point and use algebra to prove that you are correct. 

(f) Do you think there are any points with strictly positive coordinates that lie on exactly one sphere tangent to the coordinate planes? Explain.

(g) Find necessary and sufficient conditions on the point $A$ with coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ so that 

(i) $A$ lies on exactly two spheres tangent to the coordinate planes

(ii) $A$ lies on exactly one sphere tangent to the coordinate planes

(iii) $A$ lies on no sphere tangent to the coordinate planes.

(h) Find the coordinates of a specific point that lies on exactly one sphere tangent to the coordinate planes. Then use the demonsration above to check you are correct.

(i) Describe geometrically the set of points in the first octant that lie on exactly one sphere tangent to the coordinate planes. Use the demonstration to check you are correct.


\href{https://www.desmos.com/3d/ljizsai4mu}{163:Spheres in a Corner}

\end{exploration}

\end{question}



\begin{example}  \label{Ex:9090dfsadf0}
Describe algebraically and geometrically the set of points in space twice as far from the origin as from the point $B(4,2,6)$.
\end{example}



\section*{Cylinders}

It is important to be aware of the ambient space when drawing or describing a set of points. For example, the graph of the set of points satisfying the equation 
\[
    x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
depends on whether we plot the curve
\[
   \{  (x,y) \in\mathbb{R}^2 \, | \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}
\]
in two dimensions or the surface
\[
   \{  (x,y,z) \in\mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}
\]
in three dimensions. The curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a circle of unit radius centered at the origin, but the surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a circular cylinder of units radius symmetric about the $z$-axis.

Keep this idea in mind when answering the following questions.

\begin{question} \label{Q1:Coordinates}
For each of the following sets, do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Describe the set geometrically.}

\item{Sketch the set.}

\end{itemize}

(a) $\{  (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \, | \, y=3  \}$

(b) $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, y=3  \}$

(c) $\{  (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \, | \, y=2x  \}$

(d) $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, y=2x  \}$

(e) $\{  (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \, | \,  x^2 + y^2 = 6x - 8y  \}$  \hskip 0.2 in {\it Hint:} Complete the square.

(f)  $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, x^2 + y^2 = 6x - 8y  \}$

(g) $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, x^2 +4z^2 = 6x - 8z  \}$

(h) $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, y+z^2= 0  \}$

\end{question}

The surfaces in parts (b), (d), (f), and (g) above are all \emph{cylinders}, even the plane of part (b). A cylinder is a collection of parallel lines and need {\bf not} be circlular.


\section{Spheres}
A sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a set of points a fixed distance from a given point. The fixed distance is the sphere's radius and the given point is the sphere's center.




\begin{question} \label{Q522:Coordinates}
(a) Find equations of two spheres with different radii that do not intersect. Explain your reasoning.

(b) Find an equation of a third sphere that does not intersect either of the two spheres in part (a). Explain your reasoning.


\begin{hint}
Experiment with the sliders and drag the center of the green circle to help find conditions that determine when two circles 

i) do not intersect,

(ii) are externally tangent,

(iii) are internally tangent, or

(iv) intersect in two points.

(a) Find equations of two spheres with different radii that intersect in a circle that does not lie in a plane parallel to any of the coordinate planes. Explain your reasoning.

(b) Find an equation of a third sphere that passes through the circle in part (a). Explain your reasoning. 

\begin{hint} 
Starting with equations 
\[
      x^2 + y^2 - r_1^2 = 0
\]
and 
\[
    (x-a)^2 +y^2 - r_2^2 = 0 ,
\]
of two circles and two real numbers $m$ and $n$, we can write an equation of a third circle as
\[
          m(x^2 + y^2 - r_1^2) + n((x-a)^2 +y^2 - r_2^2) = 0.
\]

Experiment with the sliders $m$ and $n$ below. What do you notice about the third (blue) circle? What happens if the original two circles (green and red) do not intersect?
