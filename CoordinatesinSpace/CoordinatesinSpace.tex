The coordinates of a point on the sphere of radius $r$ with colatitude $\phi$ and longitude $\theta$ are
\[
   (x,y,z) = (\cos\theta \sin\phi, \sin\theta \sin \phi, \cos\phi ) \, , \, 0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi, \, 0\leq \phi \leq \pi .

\section{Cylinders}

It is important to be aware of the ambient space when drawing or describing a set of points. For example, the graph of the set of points satisfying the equation 
\[
    x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
depends on whether we plot the curve
\[
   \{  (x,y) \in\mathbb{R}^2 \, | \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}
\]
in two dimensions or the surface
\[
   \{  (x,y,z) \in\mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}
\]
in three dimensions. The curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a circle of unit radius centered at the origin, but the surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a circular cylinder of units radius symmetric about the $z$-axis.

Keep this idea in mind when answering the following questions.

\begin{question} \label{Q1:Coordinates}
For each of the following sets, do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Describe the set geometrically.}

\item{Sketch the set.}

\end{itemize}

(a) $\{  (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \, | \, y=3  \}$

(b) $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, y=3  \}$

(c) $\{  (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \, | \, y=2x  \}$

(d) $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, y=2x  \}$

(e) $\{  (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 \, | \,  x^2 + y^2 = 6x - 8y  \}$  \hskip 0.2 in {\it Hint:} Complete the square.

(f)  $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, x^2 + y^2 = 6x - 8y  \}$

(g) $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, x^2 +4z^2 = 6x - 8z  \}$

(h) $\{  (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3 \, | \, y+z^2= 0  \}$

\end{question}

The surfaces in parts (b), (d), (f), and (g) above are all \emph{cylinders}, even the plane of part (b). A cylinder is a collection of parallel lines and need {\bf not} be circlular.


\section{Spheres}
A sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a set of points a fixed distance from a given point. The fixed distance is the sphere's radius and the given point is the sphere's center.

\begin{question} \label{Q522:Coordinates}
(a) Find equations of two spheres with different radii that do not intersect. Explain your reasoning.

(b) Find an equation of a third sphere that does not intersect either of the two spheres in part (a). Explain your reasoning.
\end{question}

\begin{question} \label{Q52:Coordinates}
(a) Find equations of two spheres with different radii that are tangent to each other. Explain your reasoning.

(b) Find an equation of a third sphere that is tangent to both spheres in part (a). Explain your reasoning.
\end{question}


\begin{question} \label{Q53:Coordinates}
(a) Find equations of two spheres with different radii that intersect in a circle that does not lie in a plane parallel to any of the coordinate planes. Explain your reasoning.

(b) Find an equation of a third sphere that passes through the circle in part (a). Explain your reasoning. 

\end{question}


\begin{question} \label{Q533:Coordinates}
(a) Explain why the spheres
\[
     x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 25
\]
and
\[
    (x-2)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-2)^2 = 16
\]
intersect in a circle.

(b) Use trigonometry to find the radius of the circle  in part (a). Do {\bf not} use a calculator. Explain your reasoning. \it{Hint:} Draw a triangle with two vertices at the centers of the spheres and the third vertex on the circle.

\end{question}





\section{Spheres and Cylinders}
\begin{question}   \label{Q87:Coordinates}
(a) Find equations of the spheres with radii $r_1$, $r_2>0$, and respective centers $(0,0,r_1)$ and $(a,0,r_2)$

(b) Write an inequality involving $r_1$, $r_2$, and $a$ that is satisfied if and only if the spheres intersect in a circle.

(c) Assuming the spheres intersect in a circle  ${\cal C}$, find 

\hskip 0.3 in (i) an equation of the plane through  ${\cal C}$,

\hskip 0.3 in (ii) an equation of the cylinder through  ${\cal C}$ that is parallel to the $z$-axis, and

\hskip 0.3 in (ii) an equation of the cylinder through  ${\cal C}$ that is parallel to the $x$-axis.

Use the link below and follow the directions there to check if you are correct. Then experiment with the sliders as directed. What do you notice? Anything surprising?
