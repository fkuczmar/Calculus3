\begin{exploration}

The animation below shows the motion
\[
   {\bf p}_b(t) = \langle a\cos (\omega t), b \sin (\omega t)  \rangle \, , \, 0\leq t \leq 2\pi 
\]
of the rear wheel of a bicycle around an ellipse, where the components are measured in meters and time $t$ in seconds.
Here $a$, $b$, and $\omega$ are positive constants.

(a) What are the units of $a$, $b$, and $\omega$? How do you know?

(b) What is the meaning of $\omega$?

(c) Suppose the bicyle's frame has length $L$ meters ($L$ is the distance between the front and back axles.) Parameterize the motion of the front wheel. Work in general, not with the specific motion given above. That is, express the position ${\bf p}_f(t)$
of the front wheel (really the point where the wheel touches the ground) at time $t$ in terms of the vector ${\bf p}_b(t)$ and $L$.

(d) Compare the speeds of the two wheels as the bicycle moves along its path.

(e) More questions to follow.
