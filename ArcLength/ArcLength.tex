\section{Unwrapping a Spool of Thread}

\begin{question}  \label{Qgdghubhgfdg}

Imagine a thread wrapped around a spool of radius $a$ cm. Grab the free end of the thread, and uwrap it from the spool, keeping the thread taut at all times. Drag the slider $u$ in the demonstration below to see this.

Our aim is to express the speed of the free end of the thread ($P$) at any particular instant in terms of the radius $a$, the length of unwound thread $s$ (in cm), and the rate $v_A$ (in cm/sec) at which the thread is unwound from the spool. In the demonstration above, the unwinding rate is constant, but we will not assume this. 

We'll proceed as follow:

(a) First find an arclength parameterization of the circle of radius $a$ centered at the origin. Measure the arclength parameter $s$ counterclockwise around the circle, taking $s=0$ at the point $(a,0)$. Enter this parameterization in the line below, where the position vector ${\bf p}(s) = \overrightarrow{OA}$ runs from the origin to the point on the circle with arclength parameter $s$:
\[
    {\bf p}(s) = \langle \answer{a \cos (s/a)} , \answer{a \sin (s/a)}  \rangle \, , s\geq 0 
\]

(b) Next find a unit vector ${\bf T}(s)$ pointing in the direction of motion of point $A$ (this is the point where the unwrapped portion of the thread is tangent to the spool). 
\[
    {\bf T}(s) = \langle \answer{- \sin (s/a)} , \answer{\cos (s/a)}  \rangle \, , s\geq 0
\]

(c) Now find the components of the vector ${\bf q}(s) = \overrightarrow{AP}$, from $A$ to the free end of the thread. {\it Hint:} Think about the length of this vector and its direction.
\[
     {\bf q}(s) = \overrightarrow{AP} = \langle \answer{s \sin (s/a)} , \answer{-s \cos (s/a)}  \rangle \, , s\geq 0
\]

(d) Write the vector ${\bf r}(s) = \overrightarrow{OP}$ in terms of the vectors ${\bf p}(s)$ and ${\bf q}(s)$:
\begin{align*}
  {\bf r}(s)   &= {\bf p}(s) + {\bf q}(s)   \\
                  &= a \langle \answer{\cos (s/a)} , \answer{\sin (s/a)}  \rangle  +  s \langle \answer{\sin (s/a)} , \answer{-\cos (s/a)}
\end{align*}


(e) What is the meaning of the derivative $d{\bf r}(s)/dt$, where $t$ is time measured in seconds?
\begin{multipleChoice}  
\choice{The speed of point $A$}  
\choice{The speed of point $P$}  
\choice{The velocity of point $A$}  
\choice[correct]{The velocity of point $P$} 
\choice{The acceleration of point $P$} 
\end{multipleChoice} 


(f) Use your expression for ${\bf r}(s)$ from part (d), to find an expression for the derivative $d{\bf r}(s)/dt$, simplified as much as possible. Your expression should be in terms of $s$, $\theta$, and the unwinding rate $v_A$. Keep in mind that $v_A$ is also the speed of point $A$. Remember also that $s$ is a function of $t$.
\[
      \frac{d{\bf r}(s)}{dt} = \langle  \answer{\frac{s v_A}{a} \cos(s/a)}  , \answer{\frac{sv_A}{a} \sin(s/a)}   \rangle \, , \, s\geq 0 
\]


(f) What is the direction of the vector $d{\bf r}(s)/dt$? Choose all that apply.
\begin{selectAll}  
    \choice{$d{\bf r}(s)/dt$ is parallel to ${\bf q}(s)$}  
    \choice[correct]{$d{\bf r}(s)/dt$ is perpendicular to ${\bf q}(s)$}  
    \choice[correct]{$d{\bf r}(s)/dt$ is parallel to ${\bf p}(s)$}  
    \choice{$d{\bf r}(s)/dt$ is perpendicular to ${\bf p}(s)$}  
  \end{selectAll} 


(g) What is the speed of $P$?
\[
   \answer{\frac{sv_A}{a}} \,    \frac{\text cm}{\text{sec}}
\]


(h) Check that your result for the speed has the correct units. Then write the speed as a multiple of the unwiding rate $v_A$ and interpret the meaning of the multiple.

(i) Optional: Parameterize the motion of $A$ around the circle to make $P$ travel at a constant speed. This would mean expressing the arclength parameter $s$ as a function of $t$.

\[
   {\bf p}(\phi) = \langle a \cos \phi, a \sin \phi, b \phi  \rangle , \phi \geq 0 ,
\]
where $a$ and $b$ are constants with units of centimeters.
