\section*{Planetary Motion}
Kepler discovered that the planets orbit the sun in elliptical paths with the sun at a focus of the ellipse. Later Newton used calculus to prove this to be true. 

The animation below shows a point $P$ orbiting the origin, its position (in meters) at time $t$ (measured in seconds) is given by the coordinate functions
\[
       (x,y) = (a \cos (\omega t), a \sin(\omega t) \, , \, t \geq 0.
\]

\end{exploration}


While the path is elliptical, the motion is not planetary-like because the ``sun'' is at the path's center and not at a focus. That is,  $P$'s acceleration points toward the origin at all times and not toward a focus of the ellipse. Equivalently, the force acting on $P$ points toward the center of the ellipse and not toward a focus as it would for a planet. %Or in terms of forces, the gravitational force of the sun acting on a planet points directly toward the sun and therefore toward 

Nevertheless, the force acting on $P$ is \emph{central} as it always points toward a fixed point $S$. And for any such force, the segment $\overline{SP}$ from the central point (the origin in our animation) to the moving point sweeps out area at a constant rate. And we don't need to rely on Newton to show this. You already know enough from your first two calculus classes. Here's the idea.


\begin{question}  \label{Qdf4t5tht5544}
(a) (Integral Calculus) As segment $\overline{SP}$ with lenght $r$ turns through the differential angle $d\theta$, it sweeps out
a differential triangle with height $r$, base with differential length
\[
             db = \answer{r d\theta},
\]
and differential area
\[
    dA = \answer{\frac{1}{2}r^2 d\theta} .
\]

\section*{Review Questions}

\begin{question}  \label{Qdfdsftt5466544}
(a) Give your understanding of what the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says.

(b) Explain your understanding of \emph{why} the Fundamental Theorem is true. This question is not asking for any kind of proof, but for an inuitive explanation.
\end{question}


\begin{question}  \label{Q45rfdg55}
The continuous function
\[
  r = g(t) \, ,  \, 12 \leq t \leq 40,
\]
expresses the net rate (measured in gallons/minute) at which water flows into a tank in terms of the number of minutes past noon. The rate is positive when water flows into the tank and negative when water flows out. The tank holds $53$ gallons of water at 12:15pm.

Find an expression for the function
\[
    V = f(t)\, ,  \, 12 \leq t \leq 40,
\]
that expresses the volume of water in the tank (measured in gallons) in terms of the number of minutes past noon. Explain your reasoning.
