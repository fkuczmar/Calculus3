\section{Partial Derivatives}

\begin{example}  \label{Edgtr543}

The function
\[
    T = f(x,y) \, , \, x^2 + y^2 \leq 3
\]
expresses the temperature (in Celsius degrees) of a point on a hot plate in terms of its coordinates, measured in meters. 

(a) Use the graph of the level curves of this function shown below to approximate the partials 
\[
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\Big|_{(x,y)=(2,-1)} \text{ and } \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\Big|_{(x,y)=(2,-1)} .
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item{Do this by turning off the Level Curve Folder in Line 8 and first turning on the Partial x Folder in Line 14. Use the slider $T$ to adjust the level curve $f(x,y)=T$.} 

\item{Then turn off the Partial x Folder, activate the Partial y Folder, and repeat.}

\item{Follow the directions in Lines 21 and 23 to check your approximations.}

\item{Include units for the partials and explain their meanings.}

\end{itemize}

(b) Write an expression for the average rate of change in temperature with respect to the change $w$ in the $x$-coordinate relative to the point $(2,-1)$. Enter this expression on Line 22 of the above worksheet and follow the directions there to approximate 
\[
   \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\Big|_{(x,y)=(2,-1)} .
\]
Explain the idea.

(c) Write an expression for the average rate of change in temperature with respect to the change $w$ in the $y$-coordinate relative to the point $(2,-1)$. Enter this expression on Line 24 of the above worksheet and follow the directions there to approximate 
\[
   \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\Big|_{(x,y)=(2,-1)} .
\]
Explain the idea.

(d) Suppose now that 
\[
    T = f(x,y) = \sqrt{9-x^2-y^2} \, , \, x^2 + y^2 \leq 3 .
\]
Find the exact values of the two partials above and compare them with your estimates.

\begin{example}  \label{Esdtr435r}
This is a continuation of Example 1.

(c) Describe the surface
\[
  T = f(x,y) = \sqrt{9-x^2-y^2} \, , \, x^2 + y^2 \leq 3 .
\]

\pskip

(d) Write expressions  for the partials
\[
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\Big|_{(x,y)=(2,-1)} \text{ and } \frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\Big|_{(x,y)=(2,-1)} .
\]
as limits of average rates of change. Then use the demonstration below to give a geometric interpretation of the average rates of change $\Delta T/\Delta x$ and $\Delta T/\Delta y$ and their respective limits as $\Delta x\to 0$ and $\Delta y\to 0$.

(f) Parameterize the $x$-coordinate curve cut from the surface by the plane $y=-1$.

(g) Use part (f) to parameterize the tangent line to the $x$-coordinate curve at the point $P(2,-1,2)$ on the surface.

(h) Parameterize the $y$-coordinate curve cut from the surface by the plane $x=2$.

(i) Use part (h) to parameterize the tangent line to the $y$-coordinate curve at the point $P(2,-1,2)$ on the surface.

(j) Use parts (g) and (i) to find an equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point $P(2,-1,2)$.

(k) Answer parts (b) and (j) geometrically without using calculus.

(l) Use the result of part (j) to find the linear approximation to the function $T=f(x,y)$ at the point $(2,-1)$.

(M) Use your linear approximation from part (l) to estimate the temperatures at the points with coordinates $(2.1, -1.1)$ and $(1.99, -0.99)$. Without computing the actual temperatures, determine whether your estimates are greater or less than the actual values. Explain your reasoning.

\begin{example} \label{E4rt4t42}
For this entire problem let
\[
   z = f(x,y) = \arctan(y/x) 
\]
and let $P$ be the point on the graph of the function $f$ with coordinates $(\sqrt{3},1,f(\sqrt{3},1))$.

(a) Parameterize the $x$-coordinate curve cut from the surface $z=f(x,y)$ by the plane $y=1$. Use this parameterization to parameterize the tangent line to the curve at $P$.

(b) Parameterize the $y$-coordinate curve cut from the surface $z=f(x,y)$ by the plane $x=\sqrt{3}$. Use this parameterization to parameterize the tangent line to the curve at $P$.

(c) Use parts (a) and (b) to find an equation of the tangent plane to the surface $z=f(x,y)$ at $P$.

(d) Parameterize the level curve of the function $z=f(x,y)$ through the point $(\sqrt{3},1,0)$. Use this parameterization to parameterize the curve on the surface $z=f(x,y)$ lying directly above the level curve (ie. lift the level curve to the surface).

(e) Use the desmos link below to check your work by doing the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Input equations of the coordinate planes $x=\sqrt{3}$ and $y=1$.}

\item{Input parameterizations of the two coordinate curves. Use $t$ for the parameter and choose the domain $t\in[-10,10]$.}

\item{Input parameterizations of the two tangent lines. Use $t$ for the parameter and choose the domain $t\in[-10,10]$.}

\item{Input an equation of the tangent plane.}

\item{Input a parameterization for the lift of the level curve. Use $t$ for the parameter and choose the domain $t\in[-10,10]$.}

\item{Include both one or several screenshots of your work and a link to your saved file.}

\end{itemize}
