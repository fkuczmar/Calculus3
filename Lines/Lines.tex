Let ${\bf a} = \overrightarrow{OA}$ and  ${\bf b} = \overrightarrow{OB}$.

The parameterization 
\[
    {\bf r} = {\bf a} + t({\bf b} - {\bf a}) = t{\bf b} + (1-t){\bf a} , t\in \mathbb{R}
\]
is shown below. Slide $t$ and interpret the geometric meaning of the parameter $t$.

\begin{question}  \label{Qdr5577:Lines}
A light ray parallel to the vector ${\bf v} = \langle 3,2,-4 \rangle$ and passing through the point $P(12, 17,20)$ reflects off the $xy$-plane as if the plane were a mirror.

(a) Parameterize the path of the incoming light ray. Include a domain.

(b) Parameterize the path of the reflected ray. Include a domain.

(c) Repeat parts (a) and (b) for a light ray parallel to the vector ${\bf v} = \langle 2,1,4 \rangle$ through the point $P(-1,3,-7)$ that reflects off the plane through the origin that is normal to the vector ${\bf n} = \langle  1, -1, 2 \rangle$.

(d) More generally, suppose a light ray parallel to the vector ${\bf v}$ passing through the point $P$ reflects off the plane through the origin normal to the vector ${\bf n}$. Parameterize the reflected ray in terms of the vectors ${\bf v}$, ${\bf n}$, and ${\bf p} = \overrightarrow{OP}$ giving the position of $P$ relative to the origin. Avoid working with the components of these vectors. Include a domain for the parameterization.

Here is an outline of the solution to part (c):

To parameterize the reflected ray, we need to find the coordinates of a point $Q$ on the reflected ray and a vector parallel to the reflected ray. 

The only possible choice for $Q$ is the point where the incoming ray intersects the plane. To find the vector $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ giving the position of $Q$ relative to the origin, do the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item{First write a vector equation of the incoming ray with $t$ as the parameter. This equation will involve the vectors ${\bf v}$ and ${\bf  p}$ and is similar (but not identical) to the parameterization in Exploration 1 above.} 

\item{Next use your vector equation of the incoming ray to find the value of the parameter $t$ that gives the vector $\overrightarrow{OQ}$. Do this by solving an equation that describes the geometric relationship between the vectors $\overrightarrow{OQ}$ and ${\bf n}$. }

\item{Finally, use the value of the parameter in the previous step to find an expression for $\overrightarrow{OQ}$.}

\end{itemize}

Next we need to find a vector parallel to the reflected ray. For this, see the section {\bf Light Reflecting off a Mirror} in the {\bf Scalar Product} chapter of our class notes:

\href{https://ximera.osu.edu/calc3/Calculus3/ScalarProduct/ScalarProduct}{Class Notes}

Then put all this together to find a vector equation of the reflected ray. Include the appropriate domain.

The last step is to check your work in Desmos. Unfortunately, Desmos does not have a function for the scalar product of two vectors. But we can get around this by defining three scalars,
\[
    s_{vn} = {\bf v}\cdot {\bf n} ,
\]
\[
    s_{pn} =  {\bf p}\cdot {\bf n},
\]
and 
\[
       s_{nn} =  {\bf n}\cdot {\bf n} .
\]

These scalars are imbedded in the Desmos worksheet below and you will need to use them for the scalar products. Follow the directions in the worksheet to check your work.
