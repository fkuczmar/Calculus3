\begin{question} \label{QLDfmms}

This question is about using vectors to find equations of all circles in the plane through two given points having a given radius.

To be able to work in general, we need a way of finding a vector perpendicular to a given vector. We saw in the previous question, that an easy way to do this is to swap the components and negate one of them. Later in the class we'll learn how to do this with vector operations, but for now we'll use desmos to define a function $j$


In desmos, we can do this by defining
